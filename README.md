# Eventure-iOS
iOS Frontend for the Eventure app.

## Get Started
- Make sure you have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org "Official site for CocoaPods") installed.
- Navigate to the project directory in Terminal, and run `pod install`.
- Open `Eventure.workspace` in Xcode. 

## Guidelines
Here are a few guidelines that you should follow when contributing.
1. Include documentation for every defined function.
2. Refrain from using `MainMenu.storyboard`.
3. Use abstraction and minimize scope (e.g. use `private func` instead of `func` when appropriate).
4. Make sure that you *never* include our login credentials in `Global Constants.swift`!

Happy coding!
