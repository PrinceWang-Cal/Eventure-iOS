# Eventure-iOS
iOS Frontend for the Eventure app.

## Guidelines
Here are a few guidelines that you should follow when contributing.
1. Include documentation for every defined function.
2. Refrain from using `MainMenu.storyboard`.
3. Use abstraction and minimize scope (e.g. use `private func` instead of `func` when appropriate).

Happy coding!
